Small program for creating an animation of characters in the console.

To play your animation replace the scenes with an animation and correct the lenght of scenes.

If you want the animation to stand still set steps and direction to 0.

The program needs a local crate, from my repo [crab console](https://github.com/willspearshake/crab_console), clone the repo and adjust the cargo.toml path or alternatively just copy the functions in the project.

Have fun!
